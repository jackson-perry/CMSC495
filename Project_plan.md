OVERVIEW

This project plan will provide a description of group one's currency
conversion web application. It will contain detailed aspects of the
project including deliverables, project scope, team member roles,
requirements, case scenarios, and a project schedule. A communication
plan will also be included to identify the methods in which information
would be shared with stakeholders in a timely manner.

PROJECT DELIVERABLES

The currency conversion web application uses a GUI for users to convert
a monetary amount. Users will input a numeric value, select a base
currency, and select a conversion currency. After the desired values are
input, a 'convert' button may be pressed and the converted numeric value
will be displayed as output. The project will be delivered through
{......................}

PROJECT SCOPE

**Project Scope Statement**

Develop a currency conversion web application where the user will enter
information (initial value, base currency, desired conversion currency)
and the converted monetary value will be displayed.

**Project Meeting**

The project meetings are scheduled for each {DAY} at {TIME} from 5/21 to
7/8. During the first meeting, topics such as project design, team
roles, and project goals were discussed.

RESOURCE LIST

Several resources will be utilized by the team to accomplish the task of
creating the website:

1)  Personal computers for programming ({Window OS/Linux ?\....})

2)  Web-based programming tool ({Visual Studio?})

3)  Version-controlled software (GitHub repository)

4)  Open source API for conversion rates ( such as
    <https://moneymorph.dev/> )

5)  Internet access (LAN/Wi-Fi is needed)

TEAM MEMBER ROLES

**Project Manager**

This person is responsible for managing the team and organizing
meetings. They are responsible for contacting the client about any
updates or issues that occur throughout the project. They ensure that
all deadlines are met and requirements are completed. The project
manager for group one is {......\....}

**Programmer**

These individuals are responsible for writing the code for the project.
The program will be developed using Python and Flask. The team members
that will focus on the backend programming are {.........}

**User Interface Designer**

These individuals are responsible for designing the graphical user
interface for the project. The frontend of the program will be developed
with {JavaScript or html ?}. The team members that will focus on this
are {..........}

**Tester**

All team members are to ensure that each section of the project
functions as desired. Each team member will write test plans for the
portion of the project that they are responsible for developing.

REQUIREMENTS

The project will have the following functional requirements:

-   Provide a GUI that allows users to convert a base amount to another
    currency

-   The program shall allow user to enter an initial numeric value

-   The program shall allow user to select a base currency from a
    dropdown menu

-   The program shall allow user to select a desired currency from a
    dropdown menu

-   The program shall validate user input

-   The program shall only enable the 'convert' button once all
    necessary input is validated

-   The program shall display the accurate converted numeric value to
    the user

CASE SCENARIO

-   A user wants to convert an amount of money in USD to GBP

    -   The user types in the numeric value of the USD they desire to
        convert

    -   The user selects USD from the base currency dropdown menu

    -   The user selects GBP from the desired currency dropdown menu

    -   The user clicks "Convert" button

    -   The converted amount is displayed on the screen to the user

-   Error checking scenarios include:

    -   Entering a non-numeric for the initial value to be converted

    -   No selection for the base currency type

    -   No selection for the desired currency type

RISK MANAGEMENT

There can be several risk factors that may result in project delays or
that could affect the overall efficiency of the program. Some of the
risks that can be anticipated are:

-   Team Availability

    -   We may fall behind due to scheduling conflicts if we are unable
        to consistently meet and discuss the development of the project

    -   To resolve this issue, we will predetermine a set time for
        weekly communication where we will discuss what we have
        accomplished and what needs to be done. There will also be an
        ongoing chat forum via Discord

-   Teamwork

    -   Team collaboration in computer science is a new territory for
        some in the group. Members will learn to work together in a
        virtually remote setting and use version control software
        (GitHub) to submit a cohesive program.

-   Unfamiliarity with specific programming languages

    -   There are some members that may be more familiar with the
        languages chosen to create the program. Each of us is expected
        to familiarize ourselves with the languages that we will be
        using so that we are better prepared to contribute to the group.
        Open and respectful communication among members will enable us
        all to grow as programmers.
